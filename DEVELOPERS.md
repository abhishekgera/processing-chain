# Developer Guide

If you add a new feature, please use `release.sh` to create a release commit after you have committed the feature. Use a patch bump (e.g. `0.0.11` to `0.0.12`) for bugfixes that cause no functional changes, and a minor bump (e.g. `0.0.12` to `0.1.0`) for functional changes that require everyone to update the processing chain.
